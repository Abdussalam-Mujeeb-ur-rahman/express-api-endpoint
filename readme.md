# express-api-endpoint
### Overview
This repository contains an Express.js application that provides a single API endpoint. This endpoint accepts two GET request parameters, `slack_name` and `track`, and returns a JSON object containing several data points.
### Setup
Clone the repository to your local machine:
if you are using https,
```
git clone https://github.com/Abdussalam-Mujeeb-ur-rahman/express-api-endpoint.git
```
if you are using ssh key, 
```
git clone git@github.com:Abdussalam-Mujeeb-ur-rahman/express-api-endpoint.git
```
Navigate into the project directory:
```
cd express-api-endpoint
```
Install the necessary packages:
```
npm install
```
### Usage
To start the server, run:
```
node index.js
```
You can then access the API endpoint at `http://localhost:3000/api?slack_name=example_name&track=backend`. Replace `example_name` and `backend` with your actual Slack name and track.

The response will be a JSON object in the following format:
```
{
   "slack_name": "example_name",
   "current_day": "Monday",
   "utc_time": "2023-08-21T15:04:05Z",

   "status_code": 200
